Imagine a world where waiting in line for food is a thing of the past. At **Virginia Tech**, we’re making strides toward that vision with **GobbleBot**, our cutting-edge autonomous food delivery robot. Designed specifically for on-campus dining, GobbleBot combines state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) technology with intelligent navigation to deliver meals efficiently, safely, and sustainably. At the heart of this innovation lies a powerful CV method that ensures GobbleBot can navigate the bustling campus environment with ease.

## The Backbone of GobbleBot’s Vision System

The key to GobbleBot’s success is its ability to "see" and interpret its surroundings accurately. Powered by the **Arduino Nicla**, GobbleBot leverages a robust processor, an onboard **2MP camera**, and a **time-of-flight (TOF) sensor** to create a seamless perception system. These components work together to detect obstacles, identify people, and measure distances in real-time—essential capabilities for a robot operating in dynamic environments like Virginia Tech’s busy campus.

## FOMO CV Model: Smarter Detection for Safer Navigation

At the core of GobbleBot’s vision system is a **FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects)** computer vision model. This lightweight yet powerful model generates **bounding boxes** around detected individuals, providing not just their location but also a **confidence level** for each detection. By prioritizing speed and efficiency without compromising accuracy, the FOMO model allows GobbleBot to make split-second decisions while navigating crowded pathways, dining halls, or residence areas.

To further enhance situational awareness, we’ve integrated the TOF sensor into the system. This addition enables GobbleBot to measure the exact distance to detected individuals, giving it a more comprehensive understanding of its surroundings. These metrics—bounding box coordinates, confidence levels, and distance—are displayed in real-time, offering both transparency and actionable insights for improved navigation.

## Steering Guidance Algorithm: Navigating Campus Life

Building on this foundation, we’ve developed an initial algorithm designed to improve GobbleBot’s navigational intelligence. By analyzing the **position of bounding boxes** relative to the robot’s field of view and combining this information with TOF-derived distances, the algorithm generates **steering guidance**. For example, if a student is detected too close to the left side of the robot’s path, GobbleBot will adjust its trajectory to maintain safe separation.

While this algorithm represents a significant step forward, we recognize that there’s always room for improvement. Future iterations will focus on refining the logic to handle complex scenarios, such as multiple obstacles, moving targets, or unexpected environmental changes. This ongoing development ensures that GobbleBot becomes even more adept at delivering meals across Virginia Tech’s sprawling campus.

## Why GobbleBot Matters for Virginia Tech

For a campus as vibrant and active as Virginia Tech, reliable perception and intelligent decision-making are non-negotiable. Whether it’s avoiding students rushing between classes, navigating crowded dining halls during peak hours, or finding the optimal route through outdoor pathways, these features ensure that GobbleBot operates smoothly and avoids unnecessary interruptions. 

Moreover, GobbleBot aligns with Virginia Tech’s commitment to sustainability and innovation. By reducing the need for single-use delivery packaging and minimizing the carbon footprint associated with traditional food delivery methods, GobbleBot supports the university’s broader goals of environmental stewardship.

## Enhancing On-Campus Dining

GobbleBot isn’t just about delivering food—it’s about enhancing the entire on-campus dining experience. Students, faculty, and staff can enjoy their favorite meals from campus dining facilities without leaving their dorms, offices, or study spaces. With GobbleBot handling deliveries, dining services can focus on preparing high-quality meals, knowing that their creations will reach customers quickly and safely.

Additionally, GobbleBot’s human-centric design ensures that interactions between the robot and its environment are intuitive and stress-free. From displaying real-time data to adapting its path based on surroundings, GobbleBot is engineered to coexist harmoniously with the Virginia Tech community.

## Looking Ahead

This CV method marks a pivotal milestone in GobbleBot’s development journey. As we continue to iterate and refine our algorithms, sensors, and models, we’re confident that GobbleBot will set new standards for autonomous delivery robots. Our ultimate goal? To create a robot that doesn’t just deliver food—but does so with unparalleled efficiency, safety, and adaptability.

Stay tuned as we push the boundaries of what’s possible with GobbleBot. Together, let’s reimagine the future of on-campus dining at Virginia Tech—one bounding box and steering adjustment at a time!
