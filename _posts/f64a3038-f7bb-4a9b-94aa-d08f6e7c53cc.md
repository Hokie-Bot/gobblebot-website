The chassis is the backbone of any robot, and for **GobbleBot**, it’s no different. As we transitioned to a new **hub motor drive system** and addressed the challenges of our previous design, the chassis underwent a complete overhaul. These updates not only enhance the structural integrity of GobbleBot but also improve its functionality and usability. Let’s take a closer look at the key changes and innovations in GobbleBot’s redesigned chassis.

## Addressing Torsional Stress with Cross Supports

One of the biggest challenges with the previous chassis was its susceptibility to **torsional stress** caused by the direct drive motors. The high torque generated by these motors led to deformation and mechanical failures, particularly in 3D-printed components. To combat this issue, we’ve implemented several critical improvements:

- **Cross Supports:** The new chassis design incorporates additional **cross supports** to distribute stress more evenly across the frame. These reinforcements significantly reduce torsional shear stress, ensuring that the structure can withstand the demands of daily operation.
- **Enhanced Structural Integrity:** By reinforcing the chassis, we’ve created a more robust foundation that minimizes flexing and deformation. This improvement not only extends the lifespan of the chassis but also enhances the overall reliability of GobbleBot.

These upgrades are essential for supporting the new **hub motor drive system**, which, while lighter and quieter than the direct drive system, still requires a sturdy frame to function optimally.

## Adding a Scissor Lift for Improved Accessibility

In addition to strengthening the chassis, we’ve introduced a **scissor lift mechanism** to improve the usability of GobbleBot’s food storage compartments. Loading and unloading food into the compartments was previously a challenge due to the height and accessibility of the storage area. The scissor lift solves this problem by:

- **Ergonomic Design:** The scissor lift lowers the food storage compartment to a more accessible height, making it easier for staff to load meals and for users to retrieve them.
- **Streamlined Operations:** By reducing the physical effort required to interact with the compartments, the scissor lift improves efficiency and ensures that food delivery is as seamless as possible.

This feature not only enhances the user experience but also aligns with GobbleBot’s mission to provide convenient and accessible food delivery solutions.

## Lessons Learned from the Previous Chassis

The last chassis taught us valuable lessons about the importance of **structural integrity** and how design choices impact performance. The torsional stress caused by the direct drive motors highlighted the need for a more resilient design. With the new chassis, we’ve taken those lessons to heart:

- **Redesigned for Hub Motors:** The new chassis is specifically tailored to accommodate the **hub motor drive system**, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
- **Future-Proofing:** By addressing the weaknesses of the previous design, we’ve created a chassis that is better equipped to handle future upgrades and increased operational demands.

## Why These Changes Matter for GobbleBot

The redesigned chassis is a cornerstone of GobbleBot’s evolution. By addressing past challenges and incorporating innovative features like the scissor lift, we’ve created a robot that is not only stronger but also more functional and user-friendly. These improvements ensure that GobbleBot can:

- Operate reliably in the dynamic environment of Virginia Tech’s campus.
- Provide a seamless experience for both food service staff and students.
- Adapt to future enhancements without compromising performance.

## Looking Ahead

As we continue to refine GobbleBot, the chassis will remain a focal point of innovation. Future iterations may explore advanced materials for even greater durability, modular designs for easier maintenance, or additional features to further enhance usability.

The evolution of GobbleBot’s chassis reflects the team’s commitment to solving real-world problems through thoughtful engineering. Stay tuned as we continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in autonomous robotics!
